# StockApp

## This web application will allow the end user to ...

1. Manage a list of ticker symbols
2. View current market conditions through a line chart. 
3. View current price and percentage change of each symbol ( for the day ).
4. Manage news for ticker symbols.

## Here are some detailed requirements.

* The Application will be made up of 6 widgets - Chart, Ticker, News, Ticker_Add, Ticker_Details, News_Add.

* Devices with small viewports will display the widgets in one column. 

* Devices with larger viewports will display the widgets as two columns. 

* The "Ticker" Widget will always be the first displayed ( top and/or top-right ).

* Initially only the "Ticker" Widget will be displayed.

* The "Ticker" Widget will load symbols from Local Storage.

* Clicking on "Add" on the "Ticker" Widget will display the "Ticker_Add" in a Modal Dialog.

* Clicking "OK" on the "Ticker_Add" Modal Dialog will add the Ticker Symbol to Local Storage and display it in the "Ticker" widget.

* Clicking on a ticker symbol on the "Ticker" Widget will highlight it and display the "Chart", "Ticker_Details", and "News" for the symbol.

* The "News" widget will load news for the ticker symbol from Local Storage.

* Clicking on "Add" on the "News" Widget will display "News_Add" in a Modal Dialog.

* Clicking "OK" on the "News_Add" Modal Dialog will add the news to Local Storage and display it whenever the ticker symbol is selected.

## Stock Data

Stock information will be fetched live from a REST API at https://www.alphavantage.co/ The service is free and it will make the application so much more useable that with static data.

The best thing is that the service appears to be CORS-enabled by default so I can call it directly from the client w/o running into cross-domain issues.

## Additional Notes

### 11/6/2018
I found a cool tool that generates Typescript classes from JSON. This will come in handy as the JSON returned by https://www.alphavantage.co/ is very poorly formatted ( it's keys have spaces).

### 11/7/2018
I added a Routing Module. with the following routes :

/quote
/quote/{msft}
/quote/{msft}/details
/quote/{msft}/addNews
/quote/{msft}/addSymbol

I only want to show ticker-details, ticker-chart, and ticker-news when a quote is selected so I created a ticker-container and nested the informational components within it. When a symbol is selected from ticker-component I plan on adding it to the url as a param ( ex: msft; above ). I am using the ActivatedRoute class from the Router Module to "sniff" for the param on the url. I only display the quote-container if a symbol exists. This link was a lot of help: [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45309131/angular-2-4-how-to-get-route-parameters-in-app-component)
